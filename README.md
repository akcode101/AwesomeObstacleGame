# AwesomeObstacleGame

This game is a game that can be played using the Unity Engine. It involves 3 levels, where the player travels down a road and must use the
"a" key to move left and the "d" key to move right while avoiding obstacles. The last level is quite challenging, and once the player
completes it, the game ends.

This game is inspired by a Unity Youtube tutorial by Brackeys.
